# speed_dating
This project is the final group project made by Oyku Kenanlı (https://github.com/Oykukenanli) and me in the CodeOp Bootcamp. We analyzed the behavior of the participants in a quick matchmaking activity. The objective of this project is to generate a model that allows us to predict whether or not a couple are likely to make a match.

Here you will get a python file that summarizes the data preprocessing done by the 2 of us, the EDA done by me and the random forest model done by me. You will also get a ppt where is summarized all the analysis carried out in the project.

Remember to check **Oyku´s github** in case you want to review how the logistic regression and neural network models were made.
